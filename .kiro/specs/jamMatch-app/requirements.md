# Requirements Document

## Introduction

JamMatch is a musician band-matching application that uses AI-powered compatibility analysis to connect musicians and form bands. The application provides a comprehensive platform where musicians can create profiles, discover compatible band members through intelligent matching algorithms, communicate through real-time chat, and manage their band formations. The system combines location proximity, musical preferences, and experience levels to create meaningful musical connections.

6. WHEN messages are sent THEN the system SHALL include timestamp and sender information
7. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL scroll to the most recent messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a musician, I want to view detailed band profiles with compatibility information, so that I can understand why we were matched and assess the potential collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the band profile loads THEN the system SHALL show all band member details including names, instruments, and experience
3. WHEN the band profile displays THEN the system SHALL show compatibility scores between all members
4. WHEN compatibility scores are shown THEN the system SHALL include AI-generated reasoning for the scores
5. WHEN a user views a band they're not part of THEN the system SHALL restrict access appropriately
6. WHEN band member information changes THEN the system SHALL update the band profile accordingly
